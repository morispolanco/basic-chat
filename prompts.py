    "Once you're done creating the table of contents, ask me for approval so I can approve the proposed content.",
    "If I disapprove of any section, please propose an alternative.",
    "After obtaining approval, you will proceed to write each section one by one. That is, first section 1.1, then 1.2, and so on. Each section should contain 10 medium-length paragraphs.",
